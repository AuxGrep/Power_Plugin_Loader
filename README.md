# ABOUT
Its super cool us as an attacker to proceed gain access to a victim box even if the victim tried to reboot the system. "persistence" refers to techniques that attackers use to maintain access to a system even after a restart, system crash, or security cleanup. 
The goal is to ensure that the unauthorized access remains active without the need to re-exploit the vulnerable system.

For this straightforward/simple project, I am considering developing a service that monitors the battery status and detects when the user plugs in the power cable to charge their device. Upon detecting that the power cable has been connected, the service will immediately execute a malicious task to download and execute a file specified in the download link.

ENJOY!!! and be free to edit and make it yours.
